# 🚀 Executable Distribution Guide

This guide explains how to create standalone executable files that make sharing the SLS automation incredibly simple for end users.

## 🎯 What This Creates

**Instead of users needing to:**
- Install Node.js
- Run setup scripts
- Install dependencies

**They just need to:**
- Download the executable file
- Create their `data.csv` file
- Double-click to run

## 🔨 Building Executables

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
npm install -g pkg
```

### Step 2: Build Executables

**For all platforms:**
```bash
# Mac/Linux
./build-executables.sh

# Windows
build-executables.bat
```

**For specific platforms:**
```bash
npm run build-win    # Windows only
npm run build-mac    # macOS only
npm run build-linux  # Linux only
```

### Step 3: Find Your Executables

After building, you'll find these files in the `dist/` folder:
- `sls-playwright-automation-win.exe` (Windows)
- `sls-playwright-automation-macos` (macOS)
- `sls-playwright-automation-linux` (Linux)

## 📦 Distribution Packages

### For Each Platform, Create a Folder:

**Windows Package:**
```
SLS-Automation-Windows/
├── sls-playwright-automation-win.exe
├── data-sample.csv
├── config.json
└── SIMPLE-INSTRUCTIONS.txt
```

**macOS Package:**
```
SLS-Automation-Mac/
├── sls-playwright-automation-macos
├── data-sample.csv
├── config.json
└── SIMPLE-INSTRUCTIONS.txt
```

**Linux Package:**
```
SLS-Automation-Linux/
├── sls-playwright-automation-linux
├── data-sample.csv
├── config.json
└── SIMPLE-INSTRUCTIONS.txt
```

## 📋 Simple Instructions File

Create `SIMPLE-INSTRUCTIONS.txt` for each package:

```

## 🌐 Sharing Methods

### Method 1: ZIP Files
1. Create platform-specific ZIP files
2. Share via email/cloud storage
3. Recipients just extract and run

### Method 2: Cloud Storage
```
Google Drive/OneDrive Structure:
├── SLS-Automation-Windows.zip
├── SLS-Automation-Mac.zip
├── SLS-Automation-Linux.zip
└── README.txt (explains which to download)
```

### Method 3: Network Drive
Place executables on shared organizational drive with simple instructions.
